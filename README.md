# Boston Airbnb Analysis
Project of Nanodegree in Udacity

## Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity's Data Scientists Nanodegree Program. Detailed analysis with all needed code is posted in this Github repository.
I wrote my code by following CRISP-DM methodology :)

Here are my business questions!

1. Which features are influential to Price(Target Data)?
2. Which street is richest? - By our data, we can analyze which streets are Top 5 richest!
3. Relationship between Positive & Negative words in review data & review_scores, price
